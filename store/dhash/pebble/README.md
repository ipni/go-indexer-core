# Pebble Datastore

This package contains implementation of the Datastore interface that uses Pebble DB. Some of its functionality is borrowed from `store/pebble` however the two packages are sufficiently 
different to keep them separate. 

Files from `store/pebble` will be retired eventually once IPNI fully adopts Readers Privacy.
